        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I'm a Toronto-based web developer with over 20 years of experience. I primarily focus on front-end development, design systems and accessibility, but I also work with back-end technologies including AWS, Node.js and MongoDB. These days, I spend most of my time in React, Next.js and Sanity, but I've worked with many different technology stacks over the years.</p>
        <p>I started my career as a graphic designer, then transitioned into full-time web development around 2003. Early on, I worked mainly with Drupal and MySQL, then later migrated to modern JavaScript frameworks.</p>
