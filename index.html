        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I'm a Toronto-based web developer with over 20 years of experience. I primarily focus on front-end development, accessibility and design systems, but I also work with back-end technologies including AWS, Node.js and MongoDB. These days, I spend most of my time in React, but I've worked with many different technology stacks over the years. My most recent project uses Next.js and Sanity, and I'm currently learning game development with C# and Unity.</p>
        <p>I started out as a graphic designer, then transitioned into full-time web development around 2003. Early in my career, I worked mainly with Drupal and MySQL, then migrated to modern JavaScript frameworks.</p>
