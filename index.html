        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I'm a Toronto-based web developer with over 20 years of experience. My preferred areas of focus are front-end development, design systems and accessibility, but I work with various back-end technologies too. These days, I spend most of my time with React, Next.js and Sanity, but I've worked with many different technology stacks over the years.</p>
        <p>I started my career as a graphic designer, but transitioned into full-time web development around 2003.</p>
